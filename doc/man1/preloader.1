.SH NAME
preloader \- preloads a program into memory to decrease load times
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpreloader\fR [\fIoptions\fR]... \fIprogram_name\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Although dynamically built executables has several advantages over static ones,
overuse of dynamic libraries and/or large libraries can result in longer program
load times.
.PP
While this is usually not noticeable, it becomes visible in short-lived
processes, especially on older hardware and embedded devices like the Raspberry
Pi. In this scenario, the load time can consume a significant amount of the
execution time, or even more than the program's runtime.
.PP
Preloader attempts to address this issue by 'pre-loading' a program into
memory in order to reduce the program's loading time. The preloaded process
runs a server that listens for
.BR preloader_cli (1)
requests. Each request results in a new process being forked (with the
libraries already loaded) and executed with the arguments provided by
\fBpreloader_cli\fR(1).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-p, \-\-port \fIport\fR
Specifies the \fIport\fR to be listening (default: 3636). Note: Please note
that \fIport\fR is just an abstraction. Preloader uses Unix Domain Sockets
for IPC, and the port number only serves to compose the socket file name and
distinguish between multiple instances.
.TP
\fB\-b, \-\-bind\-now
Ask the dynamic linker to resolve all references immediately. This can shorten
load times, so it might be useful to use it
.TP
\fB\-d, \-\-daemonize
Run preloader as a daemon process, without blocking the terminal. Please note
that while in daemon mode, logs are only visible if they are explicitly saved
to file with the \fB-o\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-f, \-\-load\-libs \fItext_file\fR
Loads a \fItext_file\fR containing a list of libraries (one per line). This is
particularly useful when the library list is only known at runtime. The
\fButils/getlibs.sh\fR helper script can run a program and return the complete
list of libraries loaded at runtime.
.TP
\fB\-s, \-\-stop
Stops the \fBpreloader\fR server for the default port, or for a specific port if
\fB-p\fR is used.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help
Print (on the standard error) a brief usage of \fBpreloader\fR.
.PP
.SS Logging options
.TP
\fB\-o, \-\-log\-file \fIfile\fR
Save log to \fIfile\fR (default is stderr).
.TP
\fB\-l, \-\-log\-level \fIinfo|err|crit|all\fR
Specifies the log level (default: \fIinfo\fR)
.br
\fIinfo\fR: Only show information messages.
.br
\fIerr\fR: Only show error messages.
.br
\fIcrit\fR: Only show critical messages.
.br
\fIall\fR: All of the above.
.br
(Critical messages are always displayed)
